###Assignment 1 - The Command Line
`3-4 hours`

1. Read over the wiki page [[Command Line]].
2. Complete this walkthrough guide called [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). 

Your assignment assignment is to work through this guide. Make sure to actually type in all the **Do This** parts, *and* do the **Do More** sections. We can't stress enough that proficiency in the command line is important, and this guide will really help you become proficient if you actively follow it (as opposed to just reading it).

We chose this as your first assignment for a few reasons:

* It's on a fundamental skill that everything else in this course depends on.
* To show you that in this course, and in development in general, *the internet is your textbook*.
    * We'll have lectures, and in some cases we'll provide written summaries or guides to topics, but often, the best resources are out there already.
* Learning to program requires a lot of **doing** and **self-teaching**. I'll serve as your guide and help you when you get stuck, but a lot of this material requires work and practice on your part.


Also, we just want to note and re-assure you that almost every future assignment will require more creativity and building your own work (as opposed to just following instructions like in this assignment).

###Assignment 2 - Create a Personal HTML/CSS Site
`2 - 4 hours`

For this assignment, you should design and build a simple website introducing yourself to the class. This website should:
- use at least 5 types of html tags
- use at least 5 types of css styles
- if you already know any javascript, you can optionally put in a javascript function or two.

It's possible to spend an indefinitely amount of time creating a website that truly expresses yourself, but please limit yourself to just a few hours - 5 maximum. You should create your website in [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net). It won't be possible to view the site in its own window from here very easily, and that's okay for now. 

As part of this assignment, you should read through and refer to Shay Howe's [Basic and Advanced Guides to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com). There are even more HTML/CSS resources under [[Resources]], but you do not have to read them at this time.


## Submission
`5 minutes`

When you are done, do the following

1. As a wiki exercise, edit this page and add your name to the list below and include a link to your webpage.
2. Submit your **time worked** for each of the two assignments on the class google form (Found on the [[Assignments]] page).
