Total time estimated: `5-8 hours`

This week we have three parts:
- Assignment 5 focuses on git (which doesn't necessarily ever push to the web)
- Assignment 6 focuses on git + github (in which we do push to the web).
- Assignment 7 is a small ruby exercise to keep practicing.

##Assignment 5 - Git
`3-5 hours`

By the end you should be comfortable:
- Explaining what git is used for and generally how it works
- Committing changes to a branch
- Correcting mistakes in the committing process
- Explaining how tags/branches work
- Working with branches - creating them, committing changes to them, and merging them back to the 1st branch

Please become familiar using git this week. I'd recommend:
- `10 min` Videos 1 and 3 here: <http://git-scm.com/videos> - to give you a better idea of what git is for and why we use it
- `15 min` interactive tutorial: <http://try.github.io/> (just blaze through this to get a feel for it - gitimmersion is much more thorough)
- `2-4 hours` This thorough interactive tutorial: <http://gitimmersion.com/>
  - Do through and including lab 35. This is more than the previously assigned 23.
  - Of all of the resources, you will definitely learn the most through gitimmersion.
  - This one focuses on using git locally, you should work beyond this to actually push changes to github.
- `1 hour` Chapters 1, 2 and 3 here: <http://git-scm.com/book> - to explain things in detail, especially if you have questions beyond gitimmersion. At a minimum you should skim the headers of this to see what's there, it's a great reference.


##Assignment 6 - GitHub & GitHub Pages
`<1 hour`

To apply the git knowledge you're working on this week, we'll push two repositories to github, online.

- `20 min` 
  - Follow this guide: <https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote>
  - Create a public repository named "gittraining" on your github account
  - Push the repository you were using in gitimmersion to this branch. All commits should end up being "pushed" to the server
  - If that guide isn't totally helpful, please ask a question(/answer) on Piazza! :)
- `20 min` Put your personal website from week 1 on a personal github page. You can follow this guide.
  - <http://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/> (choose "already have code" and "user pages")
  - Also checkout the github help articles about "GitHub pages" if you need additional information. <https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles>
  - You can spend some time making your site more presentable if you'd like, but that's optional.
- `5 min` Go through this cute interactive diagram. I'd recommend using this last, to tie together concepts from the earlier resources and solidify why they're useful.
  - <http://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/>
  - There are a few other guides like this here: <http://guides.github.com/>
- We still have the goal of pushing our YouTube Sinatra app to Heroku, but we'll do that together in class. If you want to peek ahead:
  - Getting Started with Heroku: <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart>
  - Deploying a Sinatra App: <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rack#sinatra>

##Assignment 7 - More Ruby
`1-2 hours`

###Ruby Exercises
`1-2 hours`
Everyone should go through some more exercises to continue getting comfortable with Ruby.

To create an account you should:
- go to <http://codewars.com>
- complete the two ruby tasks
- create an account. I had some trouble logging in with github, you may have to create a non-github account

Complete at least 5 exercises on this site (more if you'd like, they're fun!). The first two you must do to sign in don't count toward this, so your user page will have 7 listed when you're done.

I recommend doing some "popular, ruby, fundamentals" problems:
http://www.codewars.com/dojo/katas/search/ruby?q=&tags=Fundamentals&beta=false&order_by=popularity+desc

We'll be able to see how many you've completed when you post your user page to this github page below.

###Ruby Challenge
`optional, 1-4 hours`

Most people in the course shouldn't spend time on this right now, and it's not required. If you think you can handle doing some additional work, this would be a great way to become more comfortable in Ruby.

Since this course has a diverse set of people with different levels of programming experience, I'll try to continue including some "challenge" assignments like this.

Try completing one of the Project Euler problems using ruby:
- <https://projecteuler.net/problems>

## Submission
`5 minutes`

When you are done, do the following

1. Submit your github page and gittraining repositories to us by putting your name in the list below.
2. Submit your codewars user page below (this will show us which exercises you completed).
3. Submit your **time worked** for each of the assignments on the class google form (Found on the [[Assignments]] page).
