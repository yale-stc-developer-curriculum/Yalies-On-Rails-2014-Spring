##Main Welcome Page

##CREATE page

  #If you'd rather print variables to the page directly you can too
  #make sure the last line in this block is the thing you want printed, and comment out anything below
  #Uncomment the next line to make some show up on the page

  #If you don't want to use pry you can comment this out, but it might help!
  #Pry will halt the server whenever it hits this line. The terminal tab you have that has the sinatra server running
  # => will have an irb-like command prompt in it and you can manipulate params and session and everything from here
  #binding.pry

  #parse the youtubelinks params into separate video numbers - from a comma separated string into an array
  #set the session stuff for the set to equal the right things

  #erb :index #we'll want it to redirect to index later (maybe optionally with a status message at the top?)
end

##SHOW page

##PLAY page

  #the submitted name from the form won't be able to change that's fine lol - because the url parameter overwrites the form's one

##DESTROY page
