##INDEX
##Main Welcome Page
get '/' do
  erb :index
end

##NEW page
get '/sets/new' do
  erb :new
end

##CREATE page
post "/sets" do
  #One way to debug is to print variable values to the page
  #make sure the last line in this block is the thing you want printed, and comment out anything below
  #Uncomment the next line to make some show up on the page
  #params.to_s

  #If you don't want to use pry you can comment this out, but it might help!
  #Pry will halt the server whenever it hits this line. The terminal tab you have that has the sinatra server running
  # => will have an irb-like command prompt in it and you can manipulate params and session and everything from here
  binding.pry
  
  #parse the youtubelinks params into separate video numbers - from a comma separated string into an array
  #set the session stuff for the set to equal the right things
  
  "success going to 'post /sets!'" #just for testing, we shouldn't render this in the end but instead render an erb
  
  #erb :index #we'll want it to redirect to index later (maybe optionally with a status message at the top?)
end

##SHOW page
get "/sets/:setname" do
  #find the set in session, set the variables to @variables so the view can have them
  erb :show #just describe what the set has in it, displaying that on the page
end

##PLAY page
get "/sets/:setname/play" do
  #find the set in session
  #Pull out a random videonumber and set that to an @variable so the view can have it
  erb :play #actually plays the embedded video!
end

##EDIT page
get "/sets/:setname/edit" do
  #parse the youtubelinks params into separate video numbers - from a comma separated string into an array
  #find the setname, set the variables to @variables so the view can have them - it will make them the form defaults
  erb :edit #same as new except it puts in the form defaults.
end

##UPDATE page
put "/sets/:setname" do
  #find setname in session
  #update the variables in session to match parameters
  "success going to 'put /sets/:setname!'" #just for testing, we shouldn't render this in the end but instead render an erb
  #erb :index #we'll want it to redirect to index later (maybe optionally with a status message at the top?)
end

##DESTROY page
delete "/sets/:setname" do
  #delete the set setname from session
  "success going to 'delete /sets/:setname'!" #just for testing, we shouldn't render this in the end but instead render an erb
  #erb :index #we'll want it to redirect to index later (maybe optionally with a status message at the top?)
